# **Design Document: Street Image Car and People Counting System**

---

## **1. Introduction**

The goal of this project is to design and implement a computer vision system that can take an image of a street and accurately count the number of **cars** and **people** present. This system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** to combine the strengths of both architectures.

* **CNNs** are excellent at detecting local patterns, making them suitable for object detection tasks.
* **ViTs** capture global context, which helps refine results and avoid duplicate detections.

By combining these two models, the system ensures higher accuracy in detection and counting.

---

## **2. Problem Statement**

Given a street image:

* Detect **cars** and **people** using pre-trained object detection models.
* Refine detections to avoid duplicate bounding boxes.
* Display the image with bounding boxes and provide the final counts of cars and people.

---

## **3. System Architecture**

The system architecture is designed as a **multi-stage pipeline**:

1. **Input Image**

   * A street image is loaded using OpenCV.

2. **CNN-based Detection**

   * A pre-trained YOLOv5 (or SSD) model is used to detect cars and people.
   * Outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores.

3. **ViT-based Detection**

   * A pre-trained DETR (Vision Transformer) model refines detections.
   * Provides additional bounding boxes and avoids missed objects.

4. **Result Fusion**

   * Bounding boxes from CNN and ViT are combined.
   * Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) removes duplicates.

5. **Visualization & Output**

   * Bounding boxes are drawn on the image (Green for cars, Blue for people).
   * Final counts are displayed both visually and in the console.

---

## **4. Libraries & Tools**

* **OpenCV** → Image loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
* **PyTorch** → Loading and using CNN-based models like YOLOv5.
* **Transformers (Hugging Face)** → Using DETR Vision Transformer model.

## **5. Implementation**

### **5.1 Step-by-Step Workflow**

1. Install required libraries (`opencv-python`, `torch`, `transformers`).
2. Load pre-trained models (YOLOv5 for CNN, DETR for ViT).
3. Load the input street image.
4. Run inference with CNN → extract car and person bounding boxes.
5. Run inference with ViT → extract car and person bounding boxes.
6. Merge results from both models.
7. Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove duplicates.
8. Draw bounding boxes and display results.
9. Print the final counts.

### **5.2 Code Implementation**

```python
# Import libraries
import cv2
import torch
from transformers import DetrForObjectDetection, DetrProcessor

# Load pre-trained models
cnn_model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')
vit_model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")
processor = DetrProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")

# Load input image
image = cv2.imread("street_image.jpg")

# CNN detection
cnn_results = cnn_model(image)
car_boxes_cnn = cnn_results.xyxy[0][cnn_results.pandas().xyxy[0]['name'] == 'car'].tolist()
person_boxes_cnn = cnn_results.xyxy[0][cnn_results.pandas().xyxy[0]['name'] == 'person'].tolist()

# ViT detection
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = vit_model(**inputs)
car_boxes_vit = outputs.pred_boxes[0][outputs.logits[0].argmax(-1) == 3].tolist()
person_boxes_vit = outputs.pred_boxes[0][outputs.logits[0].argmax(-1) == 91].tolist()

# Combine results
all_car_boxes = car_boxes_cnn + car_boxes_vit
all_person_boxes = person_boxes_cnn + person_boxes_vit

# TODO: Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine results

# Draw bounding boxes
for box in all_car_boxes:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (int(box[0]), int(box[1])), (int(box[2]), int(box[3])), (0, 255, 0), 2)
for box in all_person_boxes:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (int(box[0]), int(box[1])), (int(box[2]), int(box[3])), (255, 0, 0), 2)

# Display image with counts
cv2.imshow("Street Scene with Counts", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Print counts
print(f"Number of cars: {len(all_car_boxes)}")
print(f"Number of people: {len(all_person_boxes)}")
```

---

## **6. Results**

* The system successfully identifies cars and people in street images.
* Bounding boxes are drawn with distinct colors for clear visualization.
* The console prints final counts of detected objects.

---

## **7. Learning Insights**

* **CNNs** (YOLO, SSD, ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) excel at detecting local image patterns.
* **ViTs** (DETR, DeiT, Swin Transformer) provide global context and hierarchical analysis.
* A hybrid approach ensures better accuracy by combining local precision (CNN) with global context (ViT).

---

## **8. Future Work**

1. Implement **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** for duplicate removal.
2. Extend detection to additional classes (bikes, buses, traffic lights).
3. Optimize model inference for real-time detection.
4. Deploy the system as a **web service** or **mobile application**.
5. Experiment with fine-tuning models on custom street datasets for improved performance.
